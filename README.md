# Robotics Engineer Interview Handbook

## Goals
This document hopes to be a curated resource to guide potential candidates to success in their next job search. This was motivated from past experiences of switching from an academic background to the robotics industry. This aims to smoothen some interview shocks that candidates might face while starting their job search. The goal of the document is to serve as a starting point for your interview preparation and most of the resources in this document direct you to other formidable resources on topics. Think of it like a collection of topics you might want to know and good resources to explore the topics in detail. Keep in mind your targeted role might be a Perception Engineer; for the role you might not want to devote time on studying Motion Planning algorithms and would rather spend the time focusing on reviewing some of your Computer Vision fundamentals or visual odometry concepts.

## Target Audience
This is designed to help anyone who wants to land a job related to robotics or the autonomous car industry. It may be used by anyone who is new to technical interviewing coming from an academic background or for experienced engineers who look to be returning to the other side of the interviewing.
